## Hi, I'm Silas üëã

üéØAs a cybersecurity analyst with over 4+ years of experience, I am passionate about protecting organizations from cyber threats and ensuring the security of sensitive information. My experience includes conducting security assessments, identifying vulnerabilities, and implementing security controls to mitigate risks. I have experience in incident response, forensic analysis, penetration testing, and security operations.

üöÄI hold several industry certifications such as the CompTIA Security+ CE, Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) and the Certified Nuclear Security Professional (CNSP) which have helped me to stay current with the latest cybersecurity trends and best practices.

üòéI am always eager to learn new techniques and technologies to protect my organization and its customers better. I believe that effective cybersecurity is not just about technology, but also about understanding and managing the human element of security.

‚ö° I‚Äôm currently learning and building capacity in Python and C#, so expect lots of projects and resources that could posibbly help automate some of your work.
